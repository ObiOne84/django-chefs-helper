                        At the bottom right of each recipe there is a green button, here you can leave a comment about
                        the
                        recipe.
                        These
                        comments will appear at the bottom of the recipe. The author of the recipe will need to approve
                        comments
                        before
                        it is published. The author can also reply to your comments. The latest comments will populate
                        at
                        the
                        top.

                    <p><strong>Weighing out ingredients</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We highly recommend but is not compulsory to convert all ingredients into gram measurements
                        wherever
                        possible,
                        you can do this with 2 sets of accurate electronic kitchen scales, one from 10k to 1g and a fine
                        set
                        of
                        accurate
                        scales to 0.01g, for 1/8 or 1/4 tsp measurements, this helps with consistency, ease and any
                        future
                        modifications.
